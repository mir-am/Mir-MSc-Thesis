# A TeX Template for Writing Thesis
This TeX template is created for students of IAU (North Tehran Branch). <br />
I highly suggest students to use Tex for writing their thesis. It is much better than Microsoft Word and makes your life easier! <br />

# Installation
First of all, you need to install a TeX distribution on your system. I recommend [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) distribution. It has all the required packages for compiling this TeX template.

[XePersian](https://ctan.org/pkg/xepersian?lang=en) package is used to typeset a Persian thesis in TeX. Moreover, this template can be compiled with only XeLaTex.

# Support
If you have a question or problem with this TeX template, let me know and help you by creating an issue [here](https://github.com/mir-am/tex-thesis/issues).
